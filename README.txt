The code for music player is divided into 3 parts:
        1.HTML file-containing all the visible part of the webpage
        2.CSS file-containing all the formatting used in webpage
        3.JS file-containing the procedure and working of various buttons and links

How the site works:
        Every time you click on a song under the player, it gets played.
        When you click on a song in the list of available songs, it gets added to the playlist and dissappears from the list of available songs.
        When you click on remove button while a song is playing, the song stops,gets removed from the playlist and appears in the list of available songs.
        When a song ends ,next song in the playlist gets played automatically.

Future Plans:
        Add a feature for automatcally sorting the playlist.
        Add a feature for shuffle play.
        Add a feature for repeating a song automatically after it ends.
        Inclusion of next and previous song buttons.
